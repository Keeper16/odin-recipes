    <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
    <p>Use a pressure cooker to quickly tenderize the oxtail. It takes me 30 minutes to achieve the result, compared to around 3 hours when done the traditional way.</p>
    <p>Make sure to monitor the amount of water when boiling using the traditional method. Pour more water as needed until the meat tenderizes completely.</p>
    <p>Bagoong alamang or shrimp paste is an essential component of the dish. It should be cooked completely before serving. Refer to this bagoong recipe for guidance. You can also purchase precooked bottled bagoong alamang from the supermarket.</p>
